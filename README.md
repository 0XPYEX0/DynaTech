# ExtraStuff
A set of item and machines that I made to make things easier for me and just for fun.
Most of these could possibly be overpowered or heavily underpowered.

## Machines
**Auto-Kitchen** - If you have ExoticGarden installed, this machine will become available. It automatically crafts any Kitchen recipe inserted into it.
**Growth Chamber** - Automatically grow some plants, including sapling, cactus and sugarcane and bamboo!

##Generators
**Hydro Generator** - Generates energy from flowing water (Waterlog the generator)
**Dragon Egg Generator** - Generates energy from the warmth of a dragon egg. (Place the dragon egg on top)

## Tools
**Picnic Basket** - Its an upgraded Cooler. It can eat any ExoticGarden custom foods, or just regular vanilla foods, it has a configurable blacklist in the items.yml
