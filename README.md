# DynaTech
A set of item and machines that I made to make things easier for me and just for fun.
Most of these could possibly be overpowered or heavily underpowered.

## Machines
- **Auto-Kitchen** - If you have ExoticGarden installed, this machine will become available. It automatically crafts any Kitchen recipe inserted into it.
- **Growth Chamber** - Automatically grow some plants, including sapling, cactus and sugarcane and bamboo!
- **Antigravity Bubble** - Temporary creative flight within a 45 block area when powered.
- **Weather Controller** - Controls the weather when given a key item (Sunflower > Clear, Lilac > Rain, Creeper Head > Thunder).

## Generators
- **Hydro Generator** - Generates energy from flowing water (Waterlog the generator)
- **Dragon Egg Generator** - Generates energy from the warmth of a dragon egg. (Place the dragon egg on top)
- **Chipping Generator** - Generates energy from damaged and or durability based items
- **Culinary Generator** - Generates energy from food energy (except poisonous and bowl based food substances)

## Tools
- **Picnic Basket** - Its an upgraded Cooler. It can eat any ExoticGarden custom foods, or just regular vanilla foods, it has a configurable blacklist in the items.yml
- **Electrical Stimulator** - Feed the player for energy. 
- **Inventory Filter** - Upon item pickup, if item is the same as one in the Inventory Filter's filter it voids the item.
